# Business Problem Framework

When tackling a business problem, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure the solution aligns with organizational goals and constraints. This framework outlines the key components to consider, including business constraints, types of problems, performance metrics, and practical examples.

## 1. Business Constraints

Understanding the limitations and requirements is crucial for developing effective solutions. Here are some common business constraints:

### 1.1 Latency (Speed)
- **Definition:** The time it takes for a system to respond to a request or process data.
- **Importance:** In applications like real-time fraud detection or live customer support, high latency can lead to poor user experiences or missed opportunities.

### 1.2 Cost of Error
- **Importance:** Different errors can have varying consequences. For example, a false negative in disease detection can be more costly than a false positive.

### 1.3 Interpretability
- **Definition:** The ability to understand and explain how a model makes its decisions.
- **Importance:** In regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare), being able to explain model decisions is often required for compliance and trust.

 ### 1.4 Probability
- **Definition:** Model Confidence
- **Importance:** Probability provides insights into the confidence of the model's predictions, which is crucial for decision-making and risk management. High-confidence predictions can be acted upon more decisively, while low-confidence predictions may require further analysis or human intervention.

### 1.5 Resource Constraints
- **Definition:** Limitations related to computational resources, budget, or time.
- **Importance:** Ensures that the solution is feasible within the available infrastructure and financial limits.

## 2. Type of Problem

Identifying the nature of the problem helps in selecting the appropriate modeling techniques and evaluation metrics.

### 2.1 Classification
- **Binary Classification:** Assigning instances to one of two possible classes.
  - *Example:* Determining whether an email is "Spam" or "Not Spam."
- **Multi-class Classification:** Assigning instances to one of three or more classes.
  - *Example:* Classifying handwritten digits (0-9).

### 2.2 Regression
- **Definition:** Predicting a continuous numerical value.
  - *Example:* Forecasting house prices based on features like size and location.

### 2.3 Time Series
- **Definition:** Analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals.
  - *Example:* Predicting stock prices or weather conditions.

## 3. Performance Metric Design

Choosing the right performance metrics is vital to evaluate how well the model meets business objectives.

### 3.1 Classification

#### 3.1.1 Binary Classification

- **Precision**
  - **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
  - **Formula:** Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

- **Recall (Sensitivity)**
  - **Definition:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
  - **Formula:** Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

- **F1 Score**
  - **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
  - **Formula:**  
    F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

- **Log Loss**
  - **Definition:** Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability between 0 and 1.
  - **Use Case:** Penalizes false classifications with higher confidence.

- **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) Score**
  - **Definition:** Represents the likelihood that the model ranks a random positive instance higher than a random negative one.
  - **Use Case:** Useful for evaluating models at various threshold settings.

## 4. Scenario Prioritization

### 4.1 Spam vs. Non-Spam Classification

**Scenario:**  
Classifying incoming emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** to enhance user experience and security.

**Prioritized Metrics:**

1. **>> Precision**
   - **Reason:** Minimizes false positives, ensuring legitimate emails aren't incorrectly marked as spam, which maintains user trust and prevents important communications from being missed.

2. **>> Recall**
   - **Reason:** Maximizes detection of spam emails, enhancing security by ensuring most spam is caught.

3. **F1 Score**
   - **Reason:** Balances precision and recall, providing a single metric that accounts for both aspects.

4. **Log Loss**
    - **Definition:** Measures the performance of a classification model where the prediction is a probability between 0 and 1.
    - **Use Case:** Penalizes false classifications with higher confidence.

5. **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) Score**
   - **Reason:** Evaluates the model's overall ability to distinguish between spam and non-spam across all threshold settings.

**Reason for Prioritization:**  
Balance between catching spam and avoiding false alarms.

### 4.2 Cancer vs. Non-Cancer Classification

**Scenario:**  
Diagnosing whether a patient has cancer (**Positive**) or not (**Negative**) to ensure timely and accurate medical interventions.

**Prioritized Metrics:**

1. **>> Recall (Sensitivity)**
   - **Reason:** Crucial for patient safety by ensuring as many cancer cases as possible are detected, minimizing the risk of missing a diagnosis.

2. **>> Precision**
   - **Reason:** Reduces false positives, preventing unnecessary stress and invasive procedures for patients who do not have cancer.

3. **F1 Score**
   - **Reason:** Balances recall and precision, providing a comprehensive measure of the model's performance.

4. **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) Score**
   - **Reason:** Assesses the model's overall ability to distinguish between cancer and non-cancer cases across all threshold settings.

**Reason for Prioritization:**  
Prioritize detecting as many cancer cases as possible while managing false positives.
